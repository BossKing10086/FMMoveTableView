{"name":"Fmmovetableview","tagline":"An iOS UITableView subclass that allows you to move rows without being in edit mode simply by tapping and holding the appropriate row.","body":"FMMoveTable\r\n=======================\r\n\r\nFMMoveTable is an UITableView subclass that provides moving rows by simply tap and hold an appropriate row *without* switching the table to its edit mode.\r\n\r\n![](http://madefm.com/media/blog/FMMoveTableViewSampleImage.png)\r\n\r\nDonations\r\n---------\r\n\r\nI wrote FMMoveTable for use in one of my own apps and think that it could be quite useful (and very time-saving) for others. \r\n\r\nIf you find it helpful, a Paypal donation would be very appreciated (donation [at] madeFM [dot] com).\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to use\r\n----------\r\n\r\n1.\tImport the QuartzCore framework.\r\n2.\tAdd FMMoveTableView.(h/m) and FMMoveTableViewCell.(h/m) to your project\r\n3.\tChange you UITableView subclass to be a subclass of *FMMoveTableView*\r\n4.\tChange your UITableViewCell subclass to be a subclass of *FMMoveTableViewCell*\r\n5.\tUpdate your UI(Table)ViewController to conform to *FMMoveTableViewDataSource* and (optional) *FMMoveTableViewDelegate*\r\n6.\tImplement at least the delegate method `moveTableView:moveRowFromIndexPath:toIndexPath:` to update your model after a move\r\n7.\tImplement some additional checked in your table view data source / delegate. Check the *FMMoveViewController* for further details\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n----------\r\n\r\n**FMMoveTableView** \r\n\r\nAddopts the known UITableViewDataSource and UITableViewDelegate methods to check whether a row:\r\n\r\n* **Will move:** `moveTableView:willMoveRowAtIndexPath:`\r\n* **Can be moved:** `moveTableView:canMoveRowAtIndexPath:`\r\n* **Can move to an index path:** `moveTableView:targetIndexPathForMoveFromRowAtIndexPath:toProposedIndexPath:`\r\n* **Did move:** `moveTableView:moveRowFromIndexPath:toIndexPath:`\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n**FMMoveTableViewCell** \r\n\r\nUses a method `prepareForMove` that you may need to overwrite if you use a custom subclass. \r\n\r\nIn it's basic implementation it resets the *textLabel*, *detailTextLabel* and *imageView*.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContact\r\n-------\r\n\r\nI can't answer any questions about how to use the code, but I'd love to read any emails telling me that you're using it, creating an app with it, or just saying thanks.\r\n\r\nTake care. \r\nFlorian\r\n\r\nWeb: [http://blog.madeFM.com](http://madeFM.com)\r\nTwitter: [http://twitter.com/FlorianMielke](http://twitter.com/FlorianMielke)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense and Warranty\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nAvailable under the terms of a BSD-style open source license.\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright Â© 2012, Florian Mielke.
